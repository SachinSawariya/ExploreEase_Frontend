    history:
      "Ayodhya, located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most revered cities in Hinduism. It is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu and the protagonist of the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana. The city holds immense cultural and religious significance and is considered one of the seven sacred cities in Hinduism. According to legend, Ayodhya was founded by Manu, the progenitor of humanity in Hindu mythology, and served as the capital of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. The epicenter of Ayodhya's religious importance is the Ram Janmabhoomi, the site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama. The Babri Masjid, a mosque built by the Mughal emperor Babur in the 16th century, stood at this site until its demolition in 1992, leading to widespread communal tensions. The dispute over the site has been a contentious issue for decades, with Hindus claiming it as the birthplace of Lord Rama and demanding the construction of a temple, while Muslims seek the restoration of the mosque. Despite its turbulent history, Ayodhya remains a symbol of faith and devotion for millions of Hindus worldwide, attracting pilgrims and visitors seeking spiritual solace.",
